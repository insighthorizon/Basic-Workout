/Doing the exercise slow will achieve muscle failure (exhaustion) quicker. So nowhere to hurry./

/You can start each exercise with a very light weight as a warm up, do 10 to 20 repetitions and then try to increase the weight (resistance). No need to rest after you increase it./

/Pauses between exercises should be just as long to not puke./

/You should breathe continuously throughout the exercise, not holding breath and NOT trying to synchronize the breathing with the movement (repetitions)./

* Lower body (Legs, booty, lower back and abs)
It is 4 exercises in total for lower body (1. up to 4.). Number 1. has two choices. Do only one of them.
** 1. Squat (barbell) or Leg press (machine)
- if they have squat rack with safety bars, do squats:

- horizontal pull
  The picture is wrong. Your torso should not move during this exercise and be in the position as it is on the right. Only hands moving. But the picture shows the equipment:
