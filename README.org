/Doing the exercise slow will achieve muscle failure (exhaustion) quicker. So nowhere to hurry./

/You can start each exercise with a very light weight as a warm up, do 10 to 20 repetitions and then try to increase the weight (resistance). No need to rest after you increase it./

/Pauses between exercises should be just as long to not puke./

/You should breathe continuously throughout the exercise, not holding breath and NOT trying to synchronize the breathing with the movement (repetitions)./

* Lower body (Legs, booty, lower back and abs)
It is 4 exercises in total for lower body (1. up to 4.). Number 1. has two choices. Do only one of them.
** 1. Squat (barbell) or Leg press (machine)
- if they have squat rack with safety bars, do squats:

- otherwise leg press, don't streighten the legs, keep the muscles under load

** 2. Leg curl
