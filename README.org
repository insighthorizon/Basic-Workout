/Doing the exercise slow will achieve muscle failure (exhaustion) quicker. So nowhere to hurry./

/You can start each exercise with a very light weight as a warm up, do 10 to 20 repetitions and then try to increase the weight (resistance). No need to rest after you increase it./

/Pauses between exercises should be just as long to not puke./

/You should breathe continuously throughout the exercise, not holding breath and NOT trying to synchronize the breathing with the movement (repetitions)./

- i would do bench press (barbell) only if there is bench with safety bars set into the right height so that you can lie the weight down on it:
